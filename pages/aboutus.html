          <p>
            Imagine some of your favorite animals disappearing forever. That's
            what's happening to endangered animals. They're in danger of going
            extinct, which means they could vanish from the Earth forever.Why
            are they disappearing? Well, lots of reasons. One big problem is
            that their homes, called habitats, are getting destroyed. Trees are
            being cut down, land is being built on, and pollution is making it
            hard for them to live.Another problem is something called illegal
            wildlife trade. That's when people capture animals from the wild and
            sell them as pets or for their body parts. It's really bad for
            animals like elephants and rhinos.<br /><br />
            The race against extinction is urgent and immediate, and the
            campaign to protect these endangered and exploited species needs
            your financial support and commitment. Your support allows us to
            make an impact in saving endangered animals. Funds raised will be
            used to support ballot measures, lobbying efforts, and other
            advocacy activities in support of laws protecting endangered
            species.

            <h3>Elephant</h3>
            <p>
              Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living
              species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the
              African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only
              surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order
              Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons.

                    <h5>Description</h5>
                    <p>
                      Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among other uses. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be left- or right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear. Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Kind of Species</h5>
                    <p>
                      Two genetically different African species exist: the savanna elephant and the forest elephant, with a number of characteristics that differentiate them both. The African savanna elephant is the largest elephant species, while the Asian forest elephant and the African forest elephant are of a comparable, smaller size.
 
                      Asian elephants differ in several ways from their African relatives, with more than 10 distinct physical differences between them. For example, Asian elephants' ears are smaller compared to the large fan-shaped ears of the African species. Only some male Asian elephants have tusks, while both male and female African elephants grow tusks.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                      Reproduction And Development
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      Led by a matriarch, elephants are organized into complex social structures of females and calves, while male elephants tend to live in isolation or in small bachelor groups. A single calf is born to a female once every four to five years and after a gestation period of 22 months—the longest of any mammal. Calves are cared for by the entire herd of related females. Female calves may stay with their maternal herd for the rest of their lives, while males leave the herd as they reach puberty. Forest elephants' social groups differ slightly and may be comprised of only an adult female and her offspring. However, they may congregate in larger groups in forest clearings where resources are more abundant.
                    </p>

                      Habitats
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      Elephants need extensive land areas to survive and meet their ecological needs, which includes food, water, and space. On average, an elephant can feed up to 18 hours and consume hundreds of pounds of plant matter in a single day. As a result, as they lose habitat, they often come into conflict with people in competition for resources.
                    </p>

            <h3>Eld's deer</h3>
            <p>
              Eld's deer, also known as the thamin or brow-antlered deer, is an
              endangered species of deer endemic to South and Southeast Asia.
              The imposing species has a very regal and graceful deer physique.
              Its legs are long and thin, and it has a long, slender body with a
              large head and ears. Their coats are rough, coarse and change
              color with the season.

                    <h4>Physical Description</h4>
                    <p>
                      Eld’s deer are known for the impressive bow or lyre shaped antlers of the males (stags), which sweep back in a single curve about 99 centimeters (39 inches) long. A smaller tine grows toward the front of the head and is especially noticeable. The antlers are shed every year and reach their largest size during the breeding season.
 
                      The imposing species has a very regal and graceful deer physique. Its legs are long and thin, and it has a long, slender body with a large head and ears. Their coats are rough, coarse and change color with the season. In summer, they are reddish-brown with paler underparts. In winter, their coats are dark brown. Stags tend to have darker coloring than hinds and possess a thick mane of long hair around the neck. The tail is short in length and the rump has no distinct patch. The antlers, bow - or lyre-shaped, tend to grow outward and then inward; a smaller branch grows toward the front of the head.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                      Size
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      Males (stags) grow to about 180 centimeters (71 inches) and 125 to 175 kilograms (276 to 386 pounds). They are taller and larger than females (hinds) that stand 150 centimeters (59 inches) tall.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Native Habitat</h4>
                    <p>
                      The Eld’s deer is indigenous to Southeast Asia and was formerly widely distributed from the Manipur region of northeastern India through much of Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam to the island of Hainan, China, in the east. The deer inhabited suitable forest habitats, lowland valleys and plains, avoiding dense forests and coastal areas. Today, Eld’s deer occur in a number of protected areas throughout their former range.
 
                      Local projects have helped raise public awareness and support for conserving the deer. Hainan Datian Nature Reserve on Hainan Island, China, was established in 1976 specifically to help the brow-antlered deer recover, with the population now growing an average of 15 percent annually. This population has grown so large, in fact, that Eld’s deer have been translocated to other parts of the island, and a community education project was initiated to raise local awareness about the plight of the deer and the protected status of the sanctuary. Managed populations exist around the world, but inbreeding is common, and cooperative cross-breeding is required if managed populations are to be genetically varied enough for any future reintroduction programs into the wild.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                      Lifespan
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      The maximum recorded lifespan of a male Eld’s deer in human care was 16 years. Females can live up to 20 years in human care. Not much is known about the Eld's deer's lifespan in the wild.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                      Food/Eating Habits
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      Eld’s deer are closely associated with areas that are seasonally burned, eating the new grasses as they emerge after the fire. Grass and forbs make up the main part of their diet, which includes a variety of grasses, fruits, herbaceous and wetland plants. The species is known to graze and browse opportunistically on cultivated crops from nearby fields, such as rice, lentils, maize and peas. In human care, Eld’s deer are fed a low-protein herbivore diet and alfalfa hay. During the summer months, they are also given pasture access. Pastures must be free of fescue grass, because the deer are susceptible to fat-necrosis often associated with ingestion of endophyte-infected fescue.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                      Reproduction And Development
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      Female Eld’s deer are generally found alone or in pairs with their young. During the mating season, females and their young gather in herds of up to 50 individuals. Males also move around singly, except during mating season. When rutting takes place, males compete with each other to gain control of a harem of females with which they can mate. The breeding season takes place from Feb. to April. After a long gestation period of 34 weeks (220 to 240 days), a single fawn is born between Oct. and Nov. Like most deer species, hinds hide their young immediately after birth, concealing them in the long grass. Fawns are weaned at around five to seven months and become sexually mature at one-and-a-half to two years of age. The young have white spots at birth, which fade away as they grow.

                    The green peafowl (Pavo muticus) is a peafowl species native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It has been listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2009 because the global population has been declining rapidly and is severely fragmented due to loss of habitat.
 
                    <h4>Description </h4>
                    Unlike the related Indian peafowl, the sexes of green peafowl are quite similar in appearance, especially in the wild. Both sexes have long upper tail coverts which cover the actual tail underneath. In the male, this extends up to 2 m and is decorated with eyespots, while in the female, the coverts are green and much shorter, just covering the tail. Outside the breeding season, however, the male's train is moulted and distinguishing the sexes can be difficult unless they are observed up close. The neck and breast feathers of both sexes are iridescent green and resemble scales. In the male, the scapulars, median, and greater wing coverts are blue, while the lesser coverts are green and form a triangle of scaly feathers on the shoulder when the wing is closed. The secondaries are black and in some subspecies, the tertials are brown and/or barred with a faint pattern. The female has blue lesser coverts, so lacks the triangle at the wing shoulder. Females also have neck scales fringed with copper, as well as more barring on the back and the primaries and alula. Both sexes have shafted crests, and are long-legged, heavy-winged, and long-tailed in silhouette. The crest of the female has slightly wider plumes, while those of the male are thinner and taller. The facial skin is double striped with a white to light blue and beside the ear is a yellow to orange crescent. The dark triangle below the eye towards the eyebrow is bluish-green in the male and brown in the female. Seen from a distance, they are generally dark-coloured birds with pale vermillion- or buff-coloured primaries, which are quite visible in their peculiar flight, which has been described as a true flapping flight with little gliding that one associates with galliform birds.
 
                    Green peafowl are generally more silent than Indian peafowl. The males of some subspecies, especially P. imperator, have a loud call of ki-wao, which is often repeated. The female has a loud aow-aa call with an emphasis on the first syllable. The male may also make a similar call. The males call from their roost sites at dawn and dusk.
 
                    Green peafowl are large birds, amongst the largest living galliforms in terms of overall size, though rather lighter-bodied than the wild turkey, and perhaps the longest extant, wild bird in total length. The male is 1.8 - 3 m in total length, but this includes its tail covert (or "train") which itself measures 1.4 - 1.6 m. The tail coverts are even longer than those of the male Indian peafowl, but are shorter than those of the arguses. The adult female is around half the total length of the breeding male at 1 - 1.1 m in length. It has a relatively large wingspan that averages around 1.2 m and can reach 1.6 m in big males. The green peafowl is capable of sustained flight and is often observed on wing.
 
                    <h4>Distribution and habitat</h4>
                    The green peafowl was widely distributed in Southeast Asia in the past from eastern and north-eastern India, northern Myanmar, and southern China, extending through Laos, and Thailand into Vietnam, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia, and the islands of Java. Records from northeastern India have been questioned and old records are possibly of feral birds. The ranges have reduced with habitat destruction and hunting.
 
                    Green peafowl are found in a wide range of habitats, including primary and secondary forest, both tropical and subtropical, as well as evergreen and deciduous. They may also be found amongst bamboo, on grasslands, savannas, scrub, and farmland edge. In Vietnam, the preferred habitat was found to be dry, deciduous forest close to water and away from human disturbance. Proximity to water appears to be an important factor.
 
                    <h4>Taxonomy</h4>
                    The species was first classified as Pavo muticus by Carl Linnaeus, although it was previously described in Europe by Ulisse Aldrovandi as "Pavo Iaponensis" based on a Japanese painting given to the pope by the emperor of Japan. These birds were depicted as having no spurs; Linnaeus followed Aldrovandi's description. The Japanese had imported green peafowl from Southeast Asia for hundreds of years, and the birds were frequently depicted in Japanese paintings. As a result, the type locality described by Linnaeus was "Habitat in Japonia", though the species is not native to Japan (they were kept by the emperor and no longer occur). François Levaillant was one of the first Western ornithologists to see a live bird, imported from Macau to an animal collection in Cape of Good Hope. From an Indian painting, George Shaw described a peafowl native to India with a "blue head" and an "upright lanceolate crest", which he named Pavo spicifer, the spike-crested peacock. A third form of green peafowl was described in 1949 by Jean Delacour, as P. imperator, found in Indochina. From the advice of a bird dealer in Hong Kong, Delacour concluded there were three races of green peafowl, lumping P. spicifer into the species, as well. Today, most authorities recognise these three:
 
                    Pavo muticus muticus, the Java peafowl (nominate). Extant population endemic to the east and western ends of Java, Indonesia. Extinct populations from the Malay Peninsula from the Kra Isthmus extending south to Kedah have also been described as being synonymous with the Javanese population, but no published studies have confirmed this assumption. Often described as the most colourful of the three subspecies, the neck and breast is a metallic golden-green with cerulean blue wing coverts. Females have prominent barring on the back and tertials.
                    P. m. imperator, the Indo-Chinese peafowl. From east Myanmar to Thailand, Yunnan province in China and Indochina, this subspecies is the most common and has the widest distribution. In Thailand, it is currently confined to the Nan, Yom, Eng and Ping river basins in northern Thailand and the Huai Kha Khaeng and Mae Klong basins in western Thailand. In Vietnam, it has become extinct in the northern part of the country, its last large population being confined to the southeast in Yok Đôn and Cát Tiên National Park. imperator is intermediate in colouration between the other two forms.
                    P. m. spicifer, the Burmese peafowl. Found in Myanmar towards southwestern Thailand. Formerly also in Bangladesh as well as northern Malaysia. Birds in Northeast India are sometimes considered extinct but are still occasionally sighted. However, sightings have sometimes been questioned as feral or escaped birds. Delacour considered the west and east sides of the Irrawaddy river to be the dividing line between spicifer and imperator respectively. A population of spicifer was reintroduced to Hlawga National Park east of the Irrawaddy river. Sometimes described as "duller" than the other forms, it has a matte gun metal-blue to olive-green neck and breast, and more black on the wing-coverts and outer web of secondaries. The crown of the male is violet-blue which often extends further down the nape than other subspecies, demarcating the colours of the crown and neck.
                    Delacour dismissed several aberrant specimens to be individual variations (including the type specimens for imperator originating from the Bolaven Plateau in Laos), and stated more subspecies may be recognised with further studies. However, few studies have been conducted to substantiate Delacour's classification, even though it is accepted by nearly all authorities. Some authors have suggested that the population found in Yunnan, which are traditionally classified as imperator, may be another race. Using the cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA gene, Ouyang et al. estimated the divergence period between green and Indian peafowl to be 3 million years. In the same study, they also noted there appeared to be two different forms of green peafowl in Yunnan which should be classified as distinct subspecies. A 2005 article from The Star newspaper of Malaysia stated that research indicated the Malaysian form to be identical to the Javanese form, but the study was not published and some authors dispute the result. Due to the large range of imperator in Indochina, other subspecies within its range have also been proposed, notably annamensis of Southeast Asia and yunnanensis of Yunnan.
 
                    <h4>Behaviour</h4>
                    The green peafowl is a forest bird which nests on the ground laying 3 to 6 eggs.
 
                    It has been widely believed that the green peafowl is polygynous, but unlike the Indian peafowl, males are solitary and do not display in leks. Instead the solitary males are highly territorial and form harems with no pair bonds.
 
                    However, the theory that the male is polygynous also conflicts with observations in captivity; pairs left alone with no human interaction have been observed to be strongly monogamous. The close similarity between both sexes also suggests a different breeding system in contrast to that of the Indian peafowl. Thus, some authors have suggested that the harems seen in the field are juvenile birds and that males are not promiscuous.
 
                    They usually spend time on or near the ground in tall grasses and sedges. Family units roost in trees at a height of 10 - 15 m. The diet consists mainly of fruits, invertebrates, reptiles, frogs and rodents. As with the other member of its genus, the green peafowl can even hunt venomous snakes. Ticks and termites, flower petals, buds leaves and berries are favorite foods of adult peafowl.
 
                    <h4>Status</h4>
                    Due to hunting and a reduction in extent and quality of habitat, as well as poaching, the green peafowl is evaluated as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES. The world population has declined rapidly and the species no longer occurs in many areas of its past distribution. The last strongholds for the species are in protected areas such as Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand, Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam and Baluran National Park, Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia. The population in the wild was estimated to be about 5, 000 to 10, 000 individuals around 1995.
 
                    Although there is no natural range overlap with the Indian peafowl, hybridisation is still a threat where the Indian peafowl is introduced as they produce fertile hybrids. In captivity hybrids are called "Spalding" peafowl and are used by breeders to create different breeds. Through backcrossing some hybrids become almost indistinguishable from pure green peafowl. As the species as a whole is sometimes called "Java peafowl" in aviculture, the subspecies of green peafowl are also mixed in captivity and there are many captive birds of unknown provenance. In some areas of their native range, captive green peafowl have sometimes been released in the vicinity of a breeding station even though their true origins remain unknown.
 
                    In 2005, The Star reported that successful reintroductions were being made in Malaysia by the World Pheasant Association (WPA). The article stated that the genetic research proved the Javan and Malay peafowl were genetically identical and the subspecies muticus was introduced - the scientific community consensus. However, the assumption that the Malaysian and Javanese muticus birds are the same subspecies remains controversial, so it is uncertain which subspecies was introduced. Since the 2005 article, there has been no update on the status of the reintroduction.
 
                    <h4>Cultural significance</h4>
                    The green peafowl is often depicted in Japanese paintings from the Edo period, notably by Maruyama Ōkyo and Nagasawa Rosetsu.
 
                    The Peacock Room, an 1877-room installation by James McNeill Whistler now located in the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., prominently features paintings of green peafowl.
 
                    Although the Burmese or grey peacock-pheasant is the national bird of Myanmar, the green peafowl was an ancient symbol of the monarchs of Burma. It was also shown during British colonial times on the flag of the governor and the naval ensign, as well as on the flag of the State of Burma from 1943–1945 and on the currency of independent Burma as well.
