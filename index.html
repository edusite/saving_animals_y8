                            <h2 class="modal-title">For Animals, Plastic Is Turning the Ocean Into a Minefield.</h2>
    
                            <p>On a boat off Costa Rica, a biologist uses pliers from a Swiss army knife to try to extract a plastic straw from a sea turtle’s nostril. The turtle writhes in agony, bleeding profusely. For eight painful minutes the YouTube video ticks on; it has logged more than 20 million views, even though it’s so hard to watch. At the end the increasingly desperate biologists finally manage to dislodge a four-inch-long straw from the creature’s nose.</p>
    
                            <p>Raw scenes like this, which lay bare the toll of plastic on wildlife, have become familiar: The dead albatross, its stomach bursting with refuse. The turtle stuck in a six-pack ring, its shell warped from years of straining against the tough plastic. The seal snared in a discarded fishing net.</p>
    
                            <p>But most of the time, the harm is stealthier. Flesh-footed shearwaters, large, sooty brown seabirds that nest on islands off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand, eat more plastic as a proportion of their body mass than any other marine animal, researchers say: In one large population, 90 percent of the fledglings had already ingested some. A plastic shard piercing an intestine can kill a bird quickly. But typically the consumption of plastic just leads to chronic, unrelenting hunger.</p>
    
                            <p>“The really sad thing about this is that they’re eating plastic thinking it’s food,” says Matthew Savoca, a marine biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Imagine you ate lunch and then just felt weak and lethargic and hungry all day. That would be very confusing.” Fish such as anchovies, Savoca has found, eat plastic because it smells like food once it’s covered with algae. Seabirds, expending energy their malnourished bodies don’t have, roam farther in search of real food, only to drag back plastic waste to feed their young.</p>
    
                            <p>What makes plastic useful for people—its durability and light weight—increases the threat to animals. Plastic hangs around a long time, and a lot of it floats. “Single-use plastics are the worst. Period. Bar none,” Savoca says, referring to straws, water bottles, and plastic bags. Some 700 species of marine animals have been reported—so far—to have eaten or become entangled in plastic.</p>
    
                            <p>We don’t fully understand plastic’s long-term impact on wildlife (nor its impact on us). We haven’t been using the stuff for very long. The first documented cases of seabirds ingesting plastic were 74 Laysan albatross chicks found on a Pacific atoll in 1966, when plastic production was roughly a twentieth of what it is today. In hindsight, those birds seem like the proverbial canaries in a coal mine.</p>

                        <h2 class="modal-title">There are only two northern white rhinos left on the planet, but the species may be able to recover from the brink of extinction using frozen skin cells from deceased rhinos.</h2>

                        <p>Much of the hope for the future of the northern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) has rested on the last surviving members of the subspecies: Fatu and Najin, an infertile mother-daughter pair. But because neither can carry a pregnancy, experts are turning to genetic and reproductive innovation.</p>

                        <p>That led researchers at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in California to look at skin cells taken from 12 different northern white rhinos that are stored in their Frozen Zoo, a repository of genetic material from more than a thousand different species. Using a computer model, they simulated how the subspecies would fare if these rhinos’ genetic material was used to generate sperm and egg cells, which could then be turned into embryos and carried by females of the closely related southern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum simum).</p>

                        <p>They found that it would be possible to restore the population of northern white rhinos over multiple generations – no Fatu and Najin needed. “The beauty of having this consistent resource of genomes in the Frozen Zoo is that we can continually pull new individuals out and reintroduce them into the population,” says Aryn Wilder at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.</p>

                        <p>Their model revealed that, after 10 generations, the northern white rhinos in these simulations were not inbred – instead, they were a healthy, genetically diverse bunch. That is good news for the subspecies’ future because inbred animals tend to be more susceptible to disease and less likely to survive.</p>

                        <p>Wilder then compared the genes of those simulated rhinos to genes from the southern white rhino, which bounced back from a population of around 100 individuals in the early 1900s to about 20,000 today. “Compared to the southern white rhino, there’s actually more genetic diversity in the northern white rhino genome,” she says.</p>

                        <p>But discovering that northern white rhinos are not genetically doomed is only part of the challenge. Researchers would still need to chemically coax these frozen skin cell lines into viable sperm and egg stem cells. There is also no guarantee that southern white rhino surrogates can successfully carry the embryos of the northern white rhinos. Another way forward is cloning: the banked cell lines could be used to create a genetic copy of the deceased animals.</p>

                        <p>“There is so much more to conserving rhinos than genetic diversity in cell lines,” says Terri Roth at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden in Ohio. “But good news on any front is still worth celebrating in these tough times.”</p>

                            <p>They are unable to find food and shelter, so due to that, they stay on roads, which present a dangerous hazard to road traffic and pedestrians alike.</p>
    
                            <p>According to the data, there are 1,376 accidents caused by animals, which involve 804 dogs and 350 cattle. We often blame bad roads for road accidents and injuries, but nowadays the second most common reason for road accidents and injuries is stray animals. Stray animals are not the problem; these innocent animals are not getting proper shelter and food to survive, and for that reason, they have to come on the road in search of food and shelter.</p>
    
                            <p>To address this issue, many cities are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) video analytics to detect and alert municipal and animal health care departments. They can then respond to the alert by sending out animal health care workers to take care of the stray animals. By using stray animal detection, cities can help prevent accidents and injuries due to animals on the roads and promote smooth mobility.</p>
                            
                            <h5 class="modal-title">Benefits of Stray Animal Detection</h5>
                            <p>Swift Alerts: An AI-enabled guardian is highly active, has a close watch to detect stray animals, and sends alerts in real time so that the respective authority can be alerted. No stray animal was left unattended.
                              Enhanced Safety and Mobility: With stray animal detection, our streets are safer for everyone. Accidents and injuries, often caused by unexpected encounters with stray animals, have dropped significantly. It also makes traffic flow smoother, making our streets safer and more efficient.
                              Empowering the Visually Impaired: Stray animal detection helps people who are blind or visually impaired navigate their surroundings safely by alerting them to the presence of stray animals so that potential hazards posed by stray animals can be avoided.</p>
